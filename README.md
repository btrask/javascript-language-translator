# Javascript Language Translator

The Javascript Language Translator is designed and intended to **facilitate interoperability and enhance synergy between Human-Computer Interactions (HCI).**

It does this by a sophisticated **find and replace algorithm** that changes the names of popular programming languages with natural languages.

The Translator is _not_ intended or assumed for other purposes. The Authors will not be held liable.

## Demo Day presentation

Quirks mode:
> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

Standards mode, for enhanced compatibility:
> Node.bn® is a Bengali runtime built on Chrome's V8 Bengali engine.

As you can see, a find and replace operation was performed.

## Increase diversity

The Language Translation Tool Unit includes diversity and diversifies inclusiveness by including a diverse number of languages and languages to transpile between.

While true popularity cannot be measured, and it is never our intent to judge others as we judge ourselves, we utilize the following certified renewable sources:
- Natural language popularity: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers&oldid=985867421
- Programming language popularity: https://web.archive.org/web/20201028024557/https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/
- Other ingredients may include: https://web.archive.org/web/20201022204512/https://www.visualcapitalist.com/100-most-spoken-languages/

It is our stated intention to be carbon neutral by January 20, 2038.

## A caffeine-jolt to your productivity is one click away!
